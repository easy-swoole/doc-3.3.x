Please pay attention to the installation.
:::

- The framework uses `Composer` as the dependency management tool. Before you start installing the framework, make sure you have configured the environment and installed the `Composer` tool as described in the previous section.
- For the installation of Composer, please refer to the [Composer China Full Mirror] (https://pkg.phpcomposer.com/#how-to-install-composer) installation tutorial.
- The currently recommended image is Alibaba Cloud or Source Station.
- During the installation process, the files of the framework will be released to the project directory, please ensure that the project directory has writeable permissions.
- After the installation is complete, the App directory will not be automatically generated. Please configure it according to the `Hello World` section.
- Do not use the virtual machine shared directory as the installation directory. Otherwise, the socket cannot be created because of insufficient permissions, and an error is reported: `listen xxxxxx.sock fail `
- The shared directory generates the above error, manually change the Temp directory to another path in the dev.php configuration file.


## Switch Ali cloud image

新版安装注意事项
:::
- 新版的easyswoole安装会默认提供App命名空间，还有index控制器
- 在这里面需要填写n，不需要覆盖，已经有的 EasySwooleEvent.php，index.php dev.php produce.php

## Start frame

If there is no error in the middle, you can execute:
```bash
# Start frame
php easyswoole server start
```
At this point you can visit `http://localhost:9501` to see the welcome page of the framework, indicating that the framework has been successfully installed.
